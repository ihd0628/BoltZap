# BoltZap Terms of Service

**Last Updated: February 2, 2026**

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to BoltZap ("the App"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). BoltZap is a software interface that allows users to interact with decentralized protocols. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately cease all use of the App.

## 2. Nature of Service

### 2.1 Software Interface Only

BoltZap is provided as a **technical software interface**. The developer is a software provider and does not operate a financial institution, money transmission business, or virtual asset service provider (VASP). The App facilitates interaction with the Bitcoin, Lightning, and Liquid Network protocols but does not control these networks.

### 2.2 No Revenue from Transactions

**The developer does not collect, charge, or receive any fees from user transactions.** The App’s operational revenue is generated solely through in-app advertisements. Any transaction fees displayed within the App are collected by third-party protocols or infrastructure providers.

### 2.3 Third-Party Fees and Infrastructure

Users acknowledge that:

- **Breez LSP (Liquidity Service Provider):** Charges fees for channel management, liquidity provisioning, and atomic swap services.
- **Network Fees:** Bitcoin miners and Liquid functionaries charge fees for processing on-chain transactions.
- These fees are determined by real-time network conditions and third-party policies, which are **entirely outside the developer’s control**.

## 3. Non-Custodial Nature and User Responsibility

### 3.1 Absolute User Control

BoltZap is a **non-custodial wallet**. This means:

- Your recovery phrase (mnemonic) and private keys are encrypted and stored **exclusively on your local device**.
- The developer has no technical means to access, recover, or move your funds.
- **You are the sole "operator" of your node.** Your actions determine the safety of your assets.

### 3.2 Irreversibility and Loss of Access

- **No Recovery:** If you lose your recovery phrase, your funds are permanently lost. The developer cannot reset passwords or recover seeds.
- **Transaction Finality:** All transactions on the Bitcoin, Lightning, and Liquid networks are final. The developer cannot reverse, cancel, or modify any initiated payments.

## 4. Specific Technical Risks and Disclaimers

### 4.1 Protocol and Infrastructure Failures

Users expressly assume the risks associated with:

- **Channel Force-Closes:** In the event of a dispute or communication failure between your node and the LSP, a "Force Close" may occur. This results in on-chain transaction fees and time-locks that may delay access to your funds.
- **Swap Failures:** Technical interruptions during Lightning-to-Liquid swaps may result in temporary locking of funds or loss of service fees.
- **Breez SDK/Greenlight Outages:** The App relies on the Breez SDK and underlying infrastructure. If these services are offline, certain features of the App will be unavailable.

### 4.2 "As-Is" Provision

The App is provided **"AS IS"** without warranties of any kind. The developer does not guarantee that the App will be error-free, secure, or constantly available.

### 4.3 Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer shall not be liable for:

- Loss of funds due to **user negligence** (e.g., losing seed phrases, sharing keys).
- Loss of funds due to **software vulnerabilities** or exploits in the LDK, Breez SDK, or underlying protocols.
- **OS-level interruptions:** Mobile operating systems may terminate background processes, potentially disrupting active transactions.
- Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of the App.

## 4.4 Advertising Content

- BoltZap displays advertisements via third-party networks.
- The developer is not responsible for the content, accuracy, or legality of any advertised products or services.

## 5. Regulatory Compliance

### 5.1 Jurisdictional Legality

Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of BoltZap complies with the laws of their local jurisdiction. The developer makes no representation that the App is appropriate for use in all locations.

### 5.2 Tax Obligations

The user is solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to their Bitcoin transactions and for reporting and remitting the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.

## 6. Prohibited Use

You agree not to use BoltZap for any unlawful activities, including but not limited to money laundering, terrorist financing, or fraud. The developer reserves the right to terminate support for the App at any time without notice.

## 7. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the developer resides. Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that region.

## 8. Contact

For technical inquiries or feedback, please contact [Your Contact Information].

**BY USING BOLTZAP, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE ACTING AS YOUR OWN BANK AND ASSUME ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGING YOUR OWN PRIVATE KEYS AND INTERACTING WITH EXPERIMENTAL CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTOCOLS.**
