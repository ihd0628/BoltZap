# Bolt-zap Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 2, 2026**

Bolt-zap ("the App") is a non-custodial software interface for the Lightning and Liquid networks. Our core philosophy is built on the principle of **Data Minimization**. We do not operate a centralized backend to store your private financial information.

## 1. No Collection of Sensitive Private Data

- **Private Keys & Mnemonics:** Bolt-zap **never** accesses, collects, or stores your 12-word recovery phrase or private keys. These are generated and stored exclusively within your device's secure hardware (iOS Keychain or Android Secure Storage). If you lose this data, we cannot recover it for you.
- **Non-Custodial Nature:** We do not hold your funds. All cryptographic signatures required for transactions are performed locally on your device.

## 2. Limited Data Processing (Technical Necessity)

While we do not store your data on our own servers, the following data may be processed due to the technical nature of blockchain protocols:

- **Support Inquiries:** If you voluntarily contact us via email for support, we will process your **email address** and the content of your message. This data is used solely to resolve your inquiry.
- **Technical Metadata:** To synchronize with the blockchain, the App communicates with third-party indexers and LSPs. These external services may see your **IP address** and **Node ID** during active sessions.
- **Advertising (Optional/Future):** If the App includes advertisements, third-party providers may process device-specific identifiers (ADID/IDFA) to manage ad delivery, subject to your OS-level privacy settings.

## 3. Third-Party Service Providers

Bolt-zap acts as a bridge to decentralized networks. By using the App, you acknowledge that your metadata may be processed by:

- **Breez SDK & LSP:** To provide liquidity and routing.
- **Blockchain Indexers (e.g., Mempool.space):** To retrieve transaction history and balance.
- **Note:** These providers have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review them as they are independent of Bolt-zap.

## 4. Legal Compliance and Retention

- **Data Retention:** We generally do not retain user data. However, should we receive information via support channels, we may retain such correspondence as required by applicable laws or for the resolution of potential disputes for a period of up to 7 years, in accordance with international anti-money laundering (AML) and record-keeping standards.
- **No Sale of Data:** We do not sell, trade, or monetize any user data to third parties.

## 5. App Permissions

- **Camera:** Used strictly for scanning QR codes. No images are uploaded to any server.
- **Internet:** Necessary for the App to function and communicate with the Lightning/Liquid networks.

## 6. Refund and Finality Policy

As a non-custodial tool, Bolt-zap does not process fiat currency. **All transactions performed through the App are final and irreversible.** The developer does not have the authority to refund, cancel, or reverse any on-chain or Lightning payments.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties

Bolt-zap is provided "as-is." The developer is not responsible for any loss of funds due to software defects, third-party service failures, or user error (including loss of recovery phrases).
